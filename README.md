## üìù Notes

This game was created while following a **Pygame tutorial** as part of my learning journey.  
I have customized and experimented with different features (like **WASD movement**) to understand how game loops, event handling, and sprite rendering work in **pygame-ce**.  

[Original Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMghdHP-zs)

This project is both a **practice exercise** and a **foundation** for building more advanced games in the future.
